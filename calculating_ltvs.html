                    <h1>Calculating LTVs at an Early Stage Subscription Based Company</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Calculating the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer can be a useful metric for businesses, 
                    but it can be challenging for early-stage companies with limited historical data. Here are 
                    some steps you can take to estimate the LTV in this situation:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    1. Establish some assumptions: Since you don't have much historical data to work with, you 
                    will need to make some assumptions about your customer behavior. You could start by using 
                    the data you do have to estimate the average order value (AOV), as well as the average 
                    number of orders a customer will make across their lifetime. Assuming you do have some data
                    to work with, the AOV is a rather trivial exercise. Alternatively, the average number of 
                    lifetime orders is a bit more challenging...
                    
                    If you sell a single product and each customer can only have a single subscription, the
                    average number of lifetime orders is simply the area under the survival curve. Where the
                    X-axis of a survival curve represents the order number and the Y-axis represents the 
                    likelihood the average customer completes order number X. So, Y = 100% where X = 1 and 
                    Y decreases as X increases. In order to generate this survival curve, you'll need to 
                    start by looking at your limited historical retention data, and fitting a curve to the
                    few points you do have, in order to project out the rest of the curve. Early on, there 
                    wont be much data, which means the confidence in this curve is low, but the good news is 
                    the accuracy of the survival curve will only improve over time with additional data.
                  
                    Ex. Let's assume we have the following data points for (order number, survival percentage):
                    [(1, 100%), (2, 80%), (3, 65%), (4, 55%)]. The quickest and easiest way to calculate the 
                    LTV is to throw these values into a Google Sheet and create a scatter chart. Then click on 
                    the chart, click the "Customize" tab in the chart editor on the right, then click "Series".
                    Next scroll down and check the box next to "Trendline", change the "Label" drop down to 
                    "Use Equation" and choose the "Type" of best fit line you'd like to use. "Power Series" is
                    generally the most optimistic, followed by "Logarithmic" and "Exponential". You can take
                    the equations seen in the chart for each of the best fit lines and use them to calculate 
                    the Y values of the best fit line for each value of X.

                    2. Calculate the customer lifetime value: Once you have your assumptions, you can calculate 
                    the estimated customer lifetime value. The formula for LTV is: LTV = (Average Order Value) 
                    x (Number of Repeat Transactions) x (Average Customer Lifetime). For example, if you 
                    estimate an average order value of $50, an average of two repeat transactions per customer, 
                    and an average customer lifetime of one year, the LTV would be $100.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    3. Monitor and adjust: Keep in mind that your assumptions may change as you gather more 
                    data and refine your business model. Monitor your LTV over time and adjust your assumptions 
                    accordingly. For example, if you find that your customer retention rate is higher than 
                    expected, you may need to adjust your assumptions to reflect that.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    While estimating the LTV of a customer with limited historical data is not an exact science, 
                    it can still provide valuable insights into your business's long-term profitability and help 
                    you make data-driven decisions. As you gather more data, you can refine your LTV calculations 
                    and make more accurate predictions about your customer lifetime value.
