                    <h1>Should I be Incrementality Testing my Facebook Ad Spend?</h1>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Yes! With the launch of Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT), 
                    Facebook (and everyone else) now only have the first party data of
                    those iOS devices not opting in. Ie. Facebook platform (conversion)
                    data is not as trustworthy as it once was. 
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Prior to ATT, Facebook had eyes all over the internet thanks to its
                    Facebook Pixel capturing and sharing back the third party data of all 
                    of their advertising partners. So if you had a Facebook Pixel on your 
                    website, Facebook could directly tie all conversions which originated 
                    from a Facebook click through or view through. Now, Facebook can only 
                    see what those ATT devices do on Facebook and they have no way of 
                    knowing which of those click throughs and view throughs end up 
                    converting. Ie. we have a much worse understanding of how impactful our
                    top of funnel (Facebook) channels are at driving conversions. 
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In response to ATT, marketers now need a multi-tooled approach, as 
                    attribution is now a much more difficult puzzle to solve without the
                    ability to track iOS devices by their unique Identifier For Advertisers 
                    (IDFAs). Incrementality testing is just one of three tools I find most 
                    useful in understanding attribution in a post iOS 14 world. Note: I have 
                    written about the 2 other tools (UTM Tracking, and Media Mix Models) 
                    in prior posts.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    So what exactly is Incrementality Testing?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Incrementality testing, also known as experimental uplift modeling or 
                    causal impact testing, is a statistical method used to measure the causal 
                    impact of a marketing campaign, product feature, or any other intervention 
                    on a specific business outcome. Here we will focus on its use specifically
                    in marketing.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The goal of incrementality testing is to determine whether a particular 
                    intervention (such as a marketing campaign) causes a statistically 
                    significant change in the desired outcome, compared to a control group 
                    that did not receive the intervention.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To conduct an incrementality test, a randomized controlled experiment is 
                    typically used. A random sample of the target population is divided into 
                    two groups: the treatment group, which receives the intervention, and the 
                    control group, which does not. The outcome is then measured and compared 
                    between the two groups to determine whether the intervention had a 
                    significant effect.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Is incrementality testing a type of A/B test?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    A/B testing is a type of experiment where two or more variants of a web 
                    page, app, or marketing campaign are shown to users at random, and the 
                    results are compared to determine which variant performs better. A/B 
                    tests are often used to optimize user experience, conversion rates, or 
                    other metrics.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Incrementality testing, on the other hand, is a technique used to measure 
                    the incremental impact of a marketing campaign or other intervention. It 
                    aims to answer the question: "did this campaign cause an incremental lift 
                    in sales or other business metrics, or would the same outcome have occurred 
                    without the campaign?"
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    While A/B testing can be used as a tool to measure the incremental impact 
                    of a campaign, it is not the same as incrementality testing. Incrementality 
                    testing is typically more complex and involves more sophisticated statistical 
                    techniques, such as regression analysis or propensity score matching, to 
                    control for other factors that may have influenced the outcome.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In summary, while both A/B testing and incrementality testing involve testing 
                    different versions of a marketing campaign or other intervention, they have 
                    different objectives and methodologies.

                    Where should I use incrementality testing in performance marketing?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The most impactful place to deploy an incrementality testing is optimizing 
                    budget allocation. An incrementality test can help you determine which 
                    channels or tactics have the greatest incremental impact on business 
                    outcomes. By reallocating budgets to the most effective channels, you can 
                    maximize the return on investment of your marketing efforts.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    More specifically, all marketers should run incrementality testing on 
                    Facebook advertising spend. With the release of ATT, the impact of Facebook
                    spend is now very difficult to measure without directly testing it via
                    an incrementality test.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    How do I set up an Incrementality Test on Facebook spend?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To set up an incrementality test on Facebook spend, you can follow these 
                    general steps:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    1. Define your goals: Determine what you want to achieve with your Facebook 
                    ad spend. For example, you might want to increase sales, leads, or app 
                    installs.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    2. Choose your audience: Select a group of people to target with your ads. 
                    This group should be randomly divided into two groups with similar historical
                    performance: the test group and the control group. For the most basic test,
                    your audience will be all users.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    3. Set up the test: In the control group, your ads will be shown as usual.
                    In the test group, the same ads will be shown, but at a different level of 
                    spend. The goal is for the level of spend between the two groups to be
                    significantly different. The most common test is to completely turn off 
                    spend in the test group. Thus showing the true difference in performance
                    caused by your Facebook ad spend.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    4. Measure the results: After the test is complete, you will need to compare 
                    the results between the test and control groups. This will help you determine 
                    whether your Facebook ad spend is driving incremental lift, or if it is simply 
                    cannibalizing your organic traffic. Keep in mind, conversion data, should come 
                    directly from your sales data, NOT Facebook.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    5. Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis to determine whether the results 
                    are statistically significant. If they are, you can confidently conclude that 
                    your Facebook ad spend is driving incremental lift. If not, you may need to 
                    adjust your targeting or messaging to achieve better results.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It's worth noting that setting up an incrementality test can be complex, and 
                    may require assistance from a Facebook partner or ad agency. However, by 
                    following these general steps, you can get started on designing and executing 
                    an incrementality test for your Facebook ad spend.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Will incrementality testing improve my Marketing Mix Model (MMM)?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Lastly, incrementality testing will also improve your MMM by providing 
                    additional insights into the effectiveness of each marketing channel in driving
                    incremental revenue or conversions. Marketing mix models are analytical tools 
                    that help marketers determine how to allocate their marketing budgets across 
                    different channels, such as TV, radio, digital, print, and others, based on 
                    historical data.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    However, MMMs have limitations. The baseline assumption of an MMM is that all 
                    marketing channels have the same impact on sales or conversions. And this 
                    will continue to be the case if channel spend levels have remained consistent 
                    over time. The only way this assumption can be broken is if the historical 
                    data has varying levels of ad spend by channel and varying levels of spend 
                    distribution across those channels. Thus, incrementality testing can help 
                    validate or challenge the baseline assumptions by providing variability in 
                    historical spend. This helps the MMM isolate the incremental impact of each 
                    marketing channel, thus providing a more accurate understanding of how much 
                    each channel contributes to overall revenue or conversions.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    By combining the insights from both marketing mix models and incrementality 
                    testing, marketers can make more informed decisions about how to allocate their 
                    budgets, optimize their campaigns, and maximize their ROI. They can also use 
                    these insights to test new marketing strategies or channels, and measure their 
                    incremental impact on the business.
