                    <h1>How Long Should I Run an A/B Test?</h1>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The duration of an A/B test depends on various factors such as the magnitude of the 
                    difference you expect to observe between the two variants, the level of statistical 
                    significance you want to achieve, and the amount of traffic or data you have.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    However, as a general rule, an A/B test should run for a minimum of one week and 
                    ideally for at least two weeks to ensure that you have collected a sufficient amount 
                    of data to make an informed decision. If the sample size is small or the expected 
                    difference between the variants is large, the test may take less time to reach a 
                    conclusion. On the other hand, if the sample size is large or the expected difference 
                    between the variants is small, the test may take longer to achieve statistical 
                    significance.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It's important to note that you should not stop the test prematurely. A common misstep
                    of less experienced testers is to prematurely stop an experiment based on extreme 
                    preliminary results, especially where those initial results show strong statistical
                    significance. A best practice to avoid this mistake is to always run a power analysis
                    before launching an A/B test to determine the required sample size and duration you
                    need to acheive before you stop an A/B test.

                    What is a power analysis?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">                    
                    A power analysis is a statistical technique used to determine the sample size required 
                    to detect a specific effect size with a certain level of statistical power and 
                    significance. In other words, it helps you estimate the probability of detecting a true 
                    difference between two groups (such as the control and experimental group in an A/B 
                    test) if such a difference exists, given a certain level of uncertainty and variability 
                    in the data.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The statistical power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null 
                    hypothesis when it is false. It depends on several factors, such as the sample size, the 
                    effect size, the level of significance, and the variability of the data. Power analysis 
                    takes into account these factors and helps you determine the minimum sample size required 
                    to achieve a desired level of power and significance.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To perform a power analysis, you need to specify the effect size you want to detect, the 
                    significance level you want to use, and the statistical power you want to achieve. Based 
                    on these parameters, you can calculate the required sample size using various statistical 
                    formulas or online power analysis calculators.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Power analysis is essential for designing experiments that are statistically valid and 
                    can detect meaningful differences between groups. By estimating the required sample size 
                    in advance, you can ensure that you have enough statistical power to detect a significant 
                    difference between groups and avoid conducting an experiment with insufficient power that 
                    may result in inconclusive or misleading results.

                    Should I not check early results?

                    After you've run you're power analysis, and you have the minimum sample sizes necessary 
                    to run your A/B test, divide by your expected daily traffic to get the projected minimum 
                    number of days necessary, then round up to the nearest week or business cycle, depending 
                    on the sales fluctuation cycle of your product. Some people will say, "don't even look 
                    at results until you are at or near the end of the testing window". I say, do look, but
                    don't act, unless you see something broken. Imagine waiting for a month to look at 
                    results, only to learn the bucketing hasn't been working. You've just wasted a month of
                    testing! So do track the results to make sure the experiment is working properly, but 
                    make sure to wait until the predetermined stoping point to call the experiment.
