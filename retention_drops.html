                    <h1>Why are Retention Rates of Streaming Services Dropping?</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Subscription-based businesses, namely streaming services, saw major drop offs in retention 
                    rates during 2021. In this article, I will call out 4 of the more commonly discussed 
                    potential causes, as well as 3 additional factors not mentioned in most discussions.  
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Commonly Discussed Causes:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    1. Competition - One potential reason for a drop in retention rates could be increased 
                    competition in the streaming market. In recent years, many new streaming services have 
                    launched, including Disney+ (Nov 2019), HBO Max (May 2020), and Peacock (Apr 2020). Having
                    additional options has likely caused retention rates to drop as subscribers may opt to 
                    bounce around and try new/different platforms rather than renew.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    2. Lack of engaging content - Another factor that could impact retention rates is the 
                    content available on the platform. If viewers do not find the available content compelling 
                    or engaging, they may be less likely to continue their subscription. This could be due to 
                    the loss of popular titles or the lack of new and exciting original content. And, given 
                    the additional competitors entering the space, consumers now have more options than ever.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    3. Changing Economic Landscape - changes in the economic landscape, such as the COVID-19 
                    pandemic, may have impacted retention rates. Economic uncertainty may have led some viewers 
                    to reevaluate their spending habits, including their subscriptions to streaming services. 
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    4. Streaming Fatigue - Another common assumption is that people were tired of watching
                    streaming content. After being cooped up for so long, and having nothing else to do,
                    subscribers were excited to get back outside, travel, etc and step away from streaming 
                    content as things opened back up in 2021.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Additional Factors:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    1. Less Intent Customers - During the height of the pandemic, when much of the world had 
                    stay at home orders, most people were looking for something to do. Because of this, the
                    average subscription based streamer in 2020 and into 2021 were less intent customers. Ie.
                    many customers in 2020 and 2021 never would have subscribed in the first place if the 
                    world wasn't on lock down. As things went back to normal, these users slowly dropped off,
                    thus contributing to the drops in retention observed in 2021.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    2. Streaming Substitutes - The competition cause listed above, frequently forgets to
                    mention the impact of streaming substitutes. Shortform video content blew up during the 
                    pandemic. TikTok became a household name, and other shortform platforms followed in their 
                    footsteps, such as Youtube Shorts (Sept 2020) & Facebook Reels (Sept 2021). While not
                    direct competitors, these platforms started pulling subscribers away from their paid 
                    subscriptions and offered a free alternative form of entertainment.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    3. Changing Desires - Shortform video platforms have also changed what consumers want. 
                    These shortform platforms which allow users to instantly view the next video with a simple 
                    swipe, have made long form content feel less engaging, and shorform's ability to use AI 
                    (with more feedback data) to serve up never ending interesting content, has made long form 
                    content feel outdated and not customizable enough.
